# Multi-Layer Prototype Learning with Dirichlet Mixup for Open-Set EEG Recognition

This repository contains the implementation of the **Multi-Layer Prototype Learning with Dirichlet Mixup (MPL-DM)** framework. This framework is designed to enhance open-set EEG recognition by integrating multi-layer prototype learning and Dirichlet mixup techniques.
